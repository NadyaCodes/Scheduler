# Interview Scheduler

# Description
## Welcome to the Interview Scheduler!

With this nifty app, users can book, change and cancel interviews from Monday-Friday with their choice of interviewer. What more could they want? 

Hmm...maybe just the answers to next week's test ðŸ‘€

All changes are updated live on the page through the magic of React, and test-driven development was highly utilized throughout. Storybook, Jest and Cypress were the primary testing suites.

This project was built on a boilerplate created by Lighthouse Labs, so though I would like to take ALL the credit, I was primarily responsible for the React elements and the tests.
